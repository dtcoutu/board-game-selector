# board-game-selector
This script adds an interface for choosing a game to play from a players collection that is hosted on BoardGameGeek.

# Dependencies
* Greasemonkey - http://www.greasespot.net/ - an addon to Firefox.
* Firefox - http://www.mozilla.com/

# Installation
Install Firefox and Greasemonkey. Then download the warlocks script.
If you have a previous version of the script installed, uninstall it first - go into manage scripts in Greasemonkey. (This is because the name of the file is changing with the version number and if this ever get popular enough and fixes continue happening, then I'll try figuring out a way around it.)
Right click on the download script file and open with Firefox to have it install.
